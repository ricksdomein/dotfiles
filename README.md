# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your Linux or other Unix-based system. You can tell that a file is a dotfile because the name of the file will begin with a periodâ€“a dot! The period at the beginning of a filename or directory name indicates that it is a hidden file or directory. This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs. Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in customizing their own dotfiles.


## Usage

These dotfiles are intended to go with numerous programs I use:

- [awesomewm]() (window manager)
- [dmenu](https://github.com/ricksdomein/dmenu) (dynamic menu)
- [st](https://github.com/ricksdomein/st) (terminal emulator)


## How To Manage Your Dotfiles

I use the **git bare repository method** for managing my dotfiles. Here is an article about this method of managing dotfiles: <https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2016/02/best-way-to-store-dotfiles-git-bare-repo/>
